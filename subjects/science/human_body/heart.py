The heart is made up of four different blood-filled areas, and each of these areas is called a chamber. There are two chambers on each side of the heart. One chamber is on the top and one chamber is on the bottom. The two chambers on top are called the atria
If you're talking only about one, call it an atrium. The atria are the chambers that fill with the blood returning to the heart from the body and lungs. The heart has a left atrium and a right atrium.

The two chambers on the bottom are called the ventricles.
The heart has a left ventricle and a right ventricle. Their job is to squirt out the blood to the body and lungs.
Running down the middle of the heart is a thick wall of muscle called the septum he septum's job is to separate the left side and the right side of the heart.
The atria and ventricles work as a team.
 the atria fill with blood, then dump it into the ventricles. 
The ventricles then squeeze, pumping blood out of the heart.
While the ventricles are squeezing, the atria refill and get ready for the next contraction. 

So when the blood gets pumped, how does it know which way to go?


Well, your blood relies on four special valves inside the heart. A valve lets something in and keeps it there by closing think of walking through a door. 
The door shuts behind you and keeps you from going backward.
These valves prevent the blood from flowing backward and guide the flow of blood

We see and hear about hearts everywhere. A long time ago, people even thought that their emotions came from their hearts, maybe because the heart beats faster when a person is scared or excited. Now we know that emotions come from the brain, and in this case, the brain tells the heart to speed up. So what's the heart up to, then? How does it keep busy? What does it look like? Let's find out.

The Heart Is a Muscle
Your heart is really a muscle.
It's located a little to the left of the middle of your chest.s about the size of your fist. 
There are lots of muscles all over your body.
Muscles are in your arms, in your legs, in your back, even in your behind.
