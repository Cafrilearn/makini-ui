introduction = """
Blockchain is a decentralized database used to maintain records in a Node. A blockchain is a method used to store a list of entries or data that cannot be changed or manipulated if created. 

A Peer manages a blockchain-to-peer network. This network has a unique and specific protocol they follow that is only known to them. 

Many individuals manage and control a blockchain in a distributed ledger technology called DLT.  

In 1991, it was invented by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta. It was created to assure the integrity of digital records; they launched it in Surety in 1995

You may have heard and seen many big companies in the world integrating blockchain technology into their chain of networks. How exactly does the blockchain work, and why is it of importance? 

The goal of the blockchain is to allow all information to be recorded, distributed but not controlled and edited. 
"""

solutions = """
1. Blockchain helps with security and transparency in the financial industry. We have seen how opaque they are. With the coming of blockchain, it helps ensure no information is tampered with. 
2. Blockchain can carry out financial settlements fast and with ease through smart contracts.
3. Through peer-to-peer transactions, it reduces the amount of risk. 
4. There is always back and forth with banks, and lots of paperwork and stress come with it. However, with the help of blockchain, financial settlements are carried out faster and are more reliable. 
5. Auditing documents are always challenging and stressful, and there is no room for transparency. However, with the help of blockchain technology, auditing can be done easier and faster.

blockchain_and_bitcoin = """
If you are new to the world of cryptocurrencies, it is pretty standard for you to mix the two words, but there are significant differences between Bitcoin and Blockchain. 

Blockchain has a more established transparent process, while Bitcoin operates with Anonymity.  It is known as a digital ledger. It is seen as the chief network that supports the transaction in the Bitcoin network. 

Blockchain has a more extensive use, while bitcoin as we know it is only used as an exchange in digital currencies. 

Bitcoin is the most successful currency that has helped virtual currencies through cryptography, and we have seen many imitators.  

The goal of blockchain is to allow information to be digital and not edited among users. This technology was introduced and outlined by W. Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber in 1991.  The two researchers intended to implement a mechanism to prevent tampering with or changing document timestamps. However, it was not until over two decades later, in January 2009, that the introduction of Bitcoin came to fruition, and Blockchain technology saw its first practical use.

Bitcoin and Blockchain were first defined by a person going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto; for a while, the two terms were interchangeable. They are "a new electronic cash system with no trust third party. Thousands of blockchains have been built using similar methods. Blockchain technology has developed into its distinct concept over timeâ€”the data on the blockchain network in the instance of Bitcoin. 
"""

securing_data = """
Blockchain technology is the most secure network currently in the global economy due to its decentralized nature. In addition, the technology has been seen to be proficient enough that it offers proper encryption and validates all transactions and information. 

You can see blockchain in every economic sector, finance, entertainment, and health care. Millions cross-check it. It has proven that it can hinder anyone trying to hinder its smooth functioning. 

Blockchain is hard to attack, the technology was built decentralized, and its data are strongly backed. 

Nodes are connected in a blockchain; they act as one and are very hard or impossible to heck. 

"""

uses = """
Blockchain can be used for many reasons. One of them is how the reliability of storing data and transactions. 
1. Your local currency, for example, is seen to be controlled by the federal government; if a user's bank is hacked, all private documents regarding that person are at risk due to unstable government; with blockchain, you can help alleviate threats by operating in a decentralized network where data information cannot be hacked, thus providing a more stable currency with more applications both home and abroad. 
2. Blockchain being incorporated into healthcare would help securely and efficiently store patient records. This makes records more confidential and encoded while being stored in a blockchain. 
3. Everyone knows the hassle that comes with banking and finance, even the tiniest bit of transactions can be seen to be frustrating, mainly if it is not reflected in the account, which might be due to traffic in large numbers of transactions, or waiting to see a credit alert immediately it was sent, or debit notification coming three days after the transaction has been made. However, all this can be fixed with the help of blockchain technology, customers can perform transactions at any given time, and it gets processed in 5 minutes without hassle or delays. 

"""

risks = """
1. Poor valuations of Cryptocurrency 
2. Lack of standardization 
3. Key management 
4. Chain protection 
5. Third-party vendor risk 
6. Data privacy 
7. Disaster recovery 

"""

summary = """
The whole point of using a Blockchain network is to let people who do not trust one another share data securely and reliably.
